# 📱 How to Access AgriFundi on Your Mobile Device

## Understanding Figma Make vs Figma Design

**Important:** This is a **Figma Make web application**, not a Figma design file.

- ❌ **Won't appear** in Figma mobile app (that's for design files)
- ✅ **Will open** in your mobile web browser (Chrome, Safari, Edge, etc.)
- ✅ **Can be installed** as a PWA app on your phone

---

## ⚠️ Important Note About Installation

**The "Install app" option WON'T work in Figma Make preview!**

- ✅ **You CAN** - Open and use the app in your mobile browser
- ❌ **You CAN'T** - Install as a PWA from preview URL
- 💡 **Why?** - Preview environments don't support PWA installation
- 🚀 **Solution** - Deploy to Netlify/Vercel (free, 5 minutes) for installation to work
