## 🚫 Common Mistakes

### ❌ Trying to Install from Figma Preview
**Won't work!** Preview environments don't support PWA installation.  
**Solution:** Deploy to GitHub Pages or Netlify first.

### ❌ Uploading Only Some Files
**Won't work!** You need ALL files, especially `/public/` folder.  
**Solution:** Make sure you have the complete file structure.

### ❌ Not Waiting for Build to Complete
**Won't work!** GitHub Actions needs 2-3 minutes to build and deploy.  
**Solution:** Check the "Actions" tab and wait for green checkmark.
