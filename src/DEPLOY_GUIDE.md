## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### "Files Not Found" After Deploy

**Check:**
- All files exported from Figma Make?
- `public/` folder included?
- `manifest.json` in `/public/` ?
- Icons in `/public/icons/` ?

**Fix:**
- Re-export making sure all folders included
- Especially `/public/icons/` and `/public/manifest.json`

### "Site Works But Can't Install"

**Check:**
- Is it HTTPS? (Netlify/Vercel = auto HTTPS ✅)
- Service worker loading? (Check browser console)
- manifest.json loading? (Check Network tab)

**Fix:**
- Clear browser cache
- Hard refresh (Ctrl+Shift+R)
- Try incognito mode
- Check service worker in DevTools

### "Icons Not Showing"

**Check:**
- `/public/icons/` folder uploaded?
- All 8 SVG files present?
- manifest.json pointing to correct paths?

**Fix:**
- Ensure icon files uploaded:
  ```
  /public/icons/
    ├── icon-72x72.svg
    ├── icon-96x96.svg
    ├── icon-128x128.svg
    ├── icon-144x144.svg
    ├── icon-152x152.svg
    ├── icon-192x192.svg
    ├── icon-384x384.svg
    └── icon-512x512.svg
  ```
