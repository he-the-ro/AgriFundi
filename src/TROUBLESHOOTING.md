- Network errors

**Application Tab:**
- Manifest loads correctly
- Service worker is activated
- Cache storage populated

**Network Tab:**
- All assets loading (200 status)
- No 404 errors
- Service worker intercepting requests

### Check GitHub Actions Logs

1. Go to Actions tab
2. Click failed workflow
3. Click failed job
4. Read error messages
5. Common issues:
   - Missing files
   - Build errors
   - Wrong paths
