## ❓ "How do I upload them from my laptop?"

### **You Don't Need To!** 🎊

The icons were **automatically created directly in your project** using code. They're already in the `/public/icons/` folder and integrated into your app!

### What This Means:
- ✅ **No manual upload needed** - Icons are already there
- ✅ **No downloading required** - They're in your project
- ✅ **Already integrated** - Manifest.json references them
- ✅ **Ready to use** - Your PWA works right now!

---

## 🤔 But I'm in Figma Make (Web-Based)...

**Exactly!** That's why we generated the icons **programmatically** instead of asking you to upload files.

### How It Worked:
1. Used the `write_tool` to create SVG files
2. Saved them directly to `/public/icons/`
3. Updated `manifest.json` to reference them
4. Configured `App.tsx` with meta tags
5. **Done!** ✨

### Why SVG Files?
- 📝 **Text-based format** - Can be created with code
- 🎨 **Perfect quality** - Scales to any size
- 📦 **Smaller files** - Faster loading
- 🔧 **Easy to edit** - Just text/XML
